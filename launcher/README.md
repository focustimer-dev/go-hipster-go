# HIPSTER GO — artisanal MySpace catastrophe, professionally shipped

Live URLs:
- [Launch](https://hipster-go.samelling.workers.dev/) — launch a music request using ChatGPT or Gemini and Spotify or YouTube Music
- [Setup](https://hipster-go.samelling.workers.dev/setup/) — download current skill ZIPs and copy installation prompts
- [Legacy Gemini shortcut](https://hipster-go.samelling.workers.dev/gemini/) — launch page preselected for Gemini + YouTube Music

This is a static **Cloudflare Worker** PWA. The source lives in `launcher/`, with two real HTML pages, shared `assets/hipster.css` and `assets/app.js`, a root and a legacy Gemini PWA manifest, and an SVG star icon.

The aesthetic deliberately satirizes indie-sleaze, MySpace CSS, vintage record-store zines, urban lumberjack and artisanal beard-oil marketing. Usability is deliberately not satirical: selectors, links, copied command, statuses and accessible button states remain meaningful.

The only established streaming flows are **ChatGPT + Spotify**, with an authorized playlist writer, and **Gemini + YouTube Music**, which may generate approximate rather than exact tracklists. Cross-pairing is allowed for text-only curation and clearly warned. The launcher never submits prompts, invokes skills, creates music, stores credentials, or claims a playlist was saved.

For Android, open the live Launch page in Chrome and use **Install app** or **Add to Home screen**. Depending on the launcher, long-press exposes Happy / Angry / Sad / Weird via the web-app shortcuts. The native Gemini-app link is Android best-effort with a web fallback. The installed skill and music service still must be selected in the AI when needed. A pasted `@` mention does not guarantee activation.

The deployment is a Cloudflare Worker containing these file contents. Updating GitHub source **does not automatically deploy** the Worker. Static HTML and JS are served with no-cache; the worker serves `/setup/` and `/gemini/` along with root and app assets. The legacy Gemini manifest has scope `/` so Setup navigation stays in the same installed web app.

Run UI and behavior smoke checks after deploying: launch + setup routes render; both selectors work and warn on unsupported pairs; mood copy text updates; Android share/app handoff is optional; manifest shortcuts and ZIP links remain correct; mobile viewport does not overflow.
