# Hipster, Go! — PWA launcher

Live URLs:
- [Launch](https://hipster-go.samelling.workers.dev/) — Jukebox: prepare requests for ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude and Spotify, YouTube Music or Apple Music
- [Setup](https://hipster-go.samelling.workers.dev/setup/) — Manual: tailored setup checks, connection guidance and current skill/plugin downloads
- [Legacy Gemini shortcut](https://hipster-go.samelling.workers.dev/gemini/) — launch page preselected for Gemini + YouTube Music

This is a static **Cloudflare Worker** PWA. The source lives in `launcher/`, with two real HTML pages, shared `assets/hipster.css` and `assets/app.js`, a root and a legacy Gemini PWA manifest, and an SVG star icon.

The aesthetic deliberately satirizes indie-sleaze, MySpace CSS, vintage record-store zines, urban lumberjack and artisanal beard-oil marketing. Usability is deliberately not satirical: selectors, links, copied command, statuses and accessible button states remain meaningful.

Service selection is a preference, not evidence of a working connection. Pair-specific notes distinguish available routes: ChatGPT + Spotify requires an authorized writer; Gemini + YouTube Music may generate approximate tracklists and require a separate save; Gemini + Spotify is search/play rather than playlist creation. Claude + Spotify is subject to its connector's actual capabilities and Premium requirements. **Claude + Apple Music requires a separate compatible MCP connector**: local on Desktop or hosted for web/mobile, with track-search and playlist-writing tools. Other combinations require capability checks and can fall back to text-only curation. The launcher never submits prompts, invokes skills, creates music, stores credentials, or claims a playlist was saved.

For Android, open the live Launch page in Chrome and use **Install app** or **Add to Home screen**. Depending on the launcher, long-press exposes Happy / Angry / Sad / Weird via the web-app shortcuts. The native Gemini-app link is Android best-effort with a web fallback. The installed skill and music service still must be selected in the AI when needed. A pasted `@` mention does not guarantee activation.

The deployment is a Cloudflare Worker containing these file contents. Updating GitHub source **does not automatically deploy** the Worker. Static HTML and JS are served with no-cache; the worker serves `/setup/` and `/gemini/` along with root and app assets. The legacy Gemini manifest has scope `/` so Setup navigation stays in the same installed web app.

Run UI and behavior smoke checks after deploying: launch + setup routes render; both selectors work and warn on unsupported pairs; mood copy text updates; Android share/app handoff is optional; manifest shortcuts and ZIP links remain correct; mobile viewport does not overflow.

## First-time setup & the bearded mood clerks

The Launch page introduces setup first, then places the tailored **Copy setup check** action immediately below the AI/music selectors. Its label names the selected pair. Setup copying has its own local feedback and an expandable manual-copy fallback.

Four illustrative bearded/man-bun mood portraits are stored in `launcher/assets/hipster-moods.svg`; text labels and ARIA mood names remain separate. Moods select without copying. Tapping the selected mood again returns to plain `go`. **GO copies the current selection without clearing it.**

Copy confirmation and Open AI sit immediately below GO. Changing AI, service or mood invalidates the previous copy state; Open AI is guarded until the current prompt is copied. Copying a setup prompt also invalidates the music handoff. The receipt shows AI, service, mood and count; the full prompt and explicit manual-copy handoff remain available in a native disclosure. Clipboard failure opens that disclosure. Android sharing remains a separate action using the current prompt.

The optional tempo slider selects Slow, Relaxed, Mid-tempo, Brisk, or Fast independently of mood. Any tempo clears the preference. Tempo is included in the prompt, receipt and URL; changing it requires a fresh GO copy. These are perceived-pace preferences, not verified BPM filters.

## Manual and saved selections

The Manual uses the same AI/service selectors as the Jukebox. Copying its tailored setup check shows confirmation beside the action and changes the next link to **NEXT: OPEN…**. The user still pastes and sends the prompt. Clipboard failure opens the full prompt for manual copying; changing the selected pair clears the previous success state. Skill/plugin download links remain available in the downloads disclosure.

Changing AI preserves the selected music service, mood and tempo. AI and music-service preferences are kept in browser local storage when available. URL parameters override them; mood and tempo are carried in the Jukebox URL rather than saved as browser defaults. Supported parameters are `ai` (`chatgpt|gemini|claude`), `service` (`spotify|youtube|apple`), `mood` (`go|happy|angry|sad|weird`) and `tempo` (`slow|relaxed|moderate|brisk|fast`). Omit tempo for Any tempo.

The UI includes keyboard focus states, native disclosures, clipboard fallbacks and reduced-motion styling. These features are not a claim of a complete accessibility certification. There is **no service worker or offline cache**; home-screen installation does not make curation or setup work offline.

## Maintaining the launcher

Update the HTML, shared assets and manifests in this directory, run the repository tests, then deploy the matching content to the existing Worker. GitHub commits alone do not publish the site. Keep deployment configuration and bindings intact when replacing content; verify the live Jukebox and Manual after deployment. The root README is the visitor entry point; this file records PWA behavior, while host-specific installation details belong in `adapters/`.
